# Pangolang ü¶î
    Pangolang is a python based programming language.
Pangolang files have a file extension named `.pan`. For now it has only been tested on `windows 7 machines and higher`.

# Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è
1. Download the zip folder and run the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuRxY/pangolang/main/installer/installer.exe">pangolang installer</a>.
2. Uppon running the pangolang installer you will be asked to specify the location of a folder in which the main pangolang files will be stored. The installer will automatically add this location to the path. 
3. Installation might require a system restart. After the restart there should be a new `terminal` command called `pango`. Uppon running the command, a pangolang command line will open.

# Run Scripts üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
There are two ways to run scripts:
1. To run a pangolang script first navigate to `/pengolang_v1.2/pangolang.exe`. 
    Then you can run custom script files using the pangolang command:

    ```bash
    RUN("example.pan")
    ```

2. You can run pangolang scripts using the `pango` command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pango
    ```

    This will open a new pangolang terminal. Then you can run custom script files using the pangolang command:
    
    ```bash
    RUN("example.pan")
    ```
    
    or run commands in the pangolang command line.

# Executing Commands üìù
You can find some info about all the commands and the syntax in the `grammar.txt` file. Documentation is on the way.
